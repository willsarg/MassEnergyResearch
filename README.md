# MassEnergyResearch
Ongoing research into the Massachusetts Energy problems.

At the moment this is just one guy who is looking at the state of the energy infrastructure in Massachusetts and New England.

Problems:
- Energy Costs too much
- Majority of electric service in the state is old and unreliable
- MassSave is hurting more than it's helping
